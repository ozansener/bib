	abstract = {We consider the problem of efficient credit assignment in reinforcement
learning. In order to efficiently and meaningfully utilize new data, we propose
to explicitly assign credit to past decisions based on the likelihood of them
having led to the observed outcome. This approach uses new information in
hindsight, rather than employing foresight. Somewhat surprisingly, we show that
value functions can be rewritten through this lens, yielding a new family of
algorithms. We study the properties of these algorithms, and empirically show
that they successfully address important credit assignment challenges, through
a set of illustrative tasks.},
