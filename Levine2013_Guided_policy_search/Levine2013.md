It is a nice combination of optimal control and policy search. Basic idea in the problem is first given a set of trajectories, solve the optimal control around it. Then, using the optimal control update the policy. Main algorithmic tool is using the I-projection of the optimal policy which results in entropy regularized distribution. The learning minimizes the KL-divergence between the policies and the trajectories.
