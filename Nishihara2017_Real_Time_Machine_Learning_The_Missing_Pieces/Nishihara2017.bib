	abstract = {Machine learning applications are increasingly deployed not only to serve
predictions using static models, but also as tightly-integrated components of
feedback loops involving dynamic, real-time decision making. These applications
pose a new set of requirements, none of which are difficult to achieve in
isolation, but the combination of which creates a challenge for existing
distributed execution frameworks: computation with millisecond latency at high
throughput, adaptive construction of arbitrary task graphs, and execution of
heterogeneous kernels over diverse sets of resources. We assert that a new
distributed execution framework is needed for such ML applications and propose
a candidate approach with a proof-of-concept architecture that achieves a 63x
performance improvement over a state-of-the-art execution framework for a
representative application.},
