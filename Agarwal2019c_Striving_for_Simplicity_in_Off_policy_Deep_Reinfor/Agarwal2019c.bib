	abstract = {Reflecting on the advances of off-policy deep reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithms since the development of DQN in 2013, it is important to ask: are
the complexities of recent off-policy methods really necessary? In an attempt
to isolate the contributions of various factors of variation in off-policy deep
RL and to help design simpler algorithms, this paper investigates a set of
related questions: First, can effective policies be learned given only access
to logged offline experience? Second, how much of the benefits of recent
distributional RL algorithms is attributed to improvements in exploration
versus exploitation behavior? Third, can simpler off-policy RL algorithms
outperform distributional RL without learning explicit distributions over
returns? This paper uses a batch RL experimental setup on Atari 2600 games to
investigate these questions. Unexpectedly, we find that batch RL algorithms
trained solely on logged experiences of a DQN agent are able to significantly
outperform online DQN. Our experiments suggest that the benefits of
distributional RL mainly stem from better exploitation. We present a simple and
novel variant of ensemble Q-learning called Random Ensemble Mixture (REM),
which enforces optimal Bellman consistency on random convex combinations of the
Q-heads of a multi-head Q-network. The batch REM agent trained offline on DQN
data outperforms the batch QR-DQN and online C51 algorithms.},
