	abstract = {This paper provides lower bounds on the convergence rate of Derivative Free
Optimization (DFO) with noisy function evaluations, exposing a fundamental and
unavoidable gap between the performance of algorithms with access to gradients
and those with access to only function evaluations. However, there are
situations in which DFO is unavoidable, and for such situations we propose a
new DFO algorithm that is proved to be near optimal for the class of strongly
convex objective functions. A distinctive feature of the algorithm is that it
uses only Boolean-valued function comparisons, rather than function
evaluations. This makes the algorithm useful in an even wider range of
applications, such as optimization based on paired comparisons from human
subjects, for example. We also show that regardless of whether DFO is based on
noisy function evaluations or Boolean-valued function comparisons, the
convergence rate is the same.},
