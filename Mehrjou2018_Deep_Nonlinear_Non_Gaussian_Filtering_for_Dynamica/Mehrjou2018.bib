	abstract = {Filtering is a general name for inferring the states of a dynamical system
given observations. The most common filtering approach is Gaussian Filtering
(GF) where the distribution of the inferred states is a Gaussian whose mean is
an affine function of the observations. There are two restrictions in this
model: Gaussianity and Affinity. We propose a model to relax both these
assumptions based on recent advances in implicit generative models. Empirical
results show that the proposed method gives a significant advantage over GF and
nonlinear methods based on fixed nonlinear kernels.},
