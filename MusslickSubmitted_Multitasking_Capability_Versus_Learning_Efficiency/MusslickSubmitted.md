Main paper is on the accuracy vs learnability tradeoff in the sense of MTL. If tasks are parallizable (not using same/similar features), they both will easily perform well. But it is harder to learn since you need two parallel representations. Shared representation makes learning easier but with the cost of making parallel execution harder. So, basically classical MTL work in the sense of giving biases which does not conflict.
