	abstract = {In the past decades, intensive efforts have been put to design various loss
functions and metric forms for metric learning problem. These improvements have
shown promising results when the test data is similar to the training data.
However, the trained models often fail to produce reliable distances on the
ambiguous test pairs due to the distribution bias between training set and test
set. To address this problem, the Adversarial Metric Learning (AML) is proposed
in this paper, which automatically generates adversarial pairs to remedy the
distribution bias and facilitate robust metric learning. Specifically, AML
consists of two adversarial stages, i.e. confusion and distinguishment. In
confusion stage, the ambiguous but critical adversarial data pairs are
adaptively generated to mislead the learned metric. In distinguishment stage, a
metric is exhaustively learned to try its best to distinguish both the
adversarial pairs and the original training pairs. Thanks to the challenges
posed by the confusion stage in such competing process, the AML model is able
to grasp plentiful difficult knowledge that has not been contained by the
original training pairs, so the discriminability of AML can be significantly
improved. The entire model is formulated into optimization framework, of which
the global convergence is theoretically proved. The experimental results on toy
data and practical datasets clearly demonstrate the superiority of AML to the
representative state-of-the-art metric learning methodologies.},
