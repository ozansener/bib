	abstract = {The question of generalization in machine learning---how algorithms are able
to learn predictors from a training sample to make accurate predictions
out-of-sample---is revisited in light of the recent breakthroughs in modern
machine learning technology.
  The classical approach to understanding generalization is based on
bias-variance trade-offs, where model complexity is carefully calibrated so
that the fit on the training sample reflects performance out-of-sample.
  However, it is now common practice to fit highly complex models like deep
neural networks to data with (nearly) zero training error, and yet these
interpolating predictors are observed to have good out-of-sample accuracy even
for noisy data.
  How can the classical understanding of generalization be reconciled with
these observations from modern machine learning practice?
  In this paper, we bridge the two regimes by exhibiting a new "double descent"
risk curve that extends the traditional U-shaped bias-variance curve beyond the
point of interpolation.
  Specifically, the curve shows that as soon as the model complexity is high
enough to achieve interpolation on the training sample---a point that we call
the "interpolation threshold"---the risk of suitably chosen interpolating
predictors from these models can, in fact, be decreasing as the model
complexity increases, often below the risk achieved using non-interpolating
models.
  The double descent risk curve is demonstrated for a broad range of models,
including neural networks and random forests, and a mechanism for producing
this behavior is posited.},
