	abstract = {In this work we introduce the algorithm (S)NOWPAC (Stochastic Nonlinear
Optimization With Path-Augmented Constraints) for stochastic nonlinear
constrained derivative-free optimization. The algorithm extends the
derivative-free optimizer NOWPAC to be applicable to nonlinear stochastic
programming. It is based on a trust region framework, utilizing local fully
linear surrogate models combined with Gaussian process surrogates to mitigate
the noise in the objective function and constraint evaluations. We show several
benchmark results that demonstrate (S)NOWPAC's efficiency and highlight the
accuracy of the optimal solutions found.},
