	abstract = {Dealing with uncertainty is essential for efficient reinforcement learning.
There is a growing literature on uncertainty estimation for deep learning from
fixed datasets, but many of the most popular approaches are poorly-suited to
sequential decision problems. Other methods, such as bootstrap sampling, have
no mechanism for uncertainty that does not come from the observed data. We
highlight why this can be a crucial shortcoming and propose a simple remedy
through addition of a randomized untrainable `prior' network to each ensemble
member. We prove that this approach is efficient with linear representations,
provide simple illustrations of its efficacy with nonlinear representations and
show that this approach scales to large-scale problems far better than previous
attempts.},
