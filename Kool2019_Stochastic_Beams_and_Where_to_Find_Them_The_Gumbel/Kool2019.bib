	abstract = {The well-known Gumbel-Max trick for sampling from a categorical distribution
can be extended to sample $k$ elements without replacement. We show how to
implicitly apply this 'Gumbel-Top-$k$' trick on a factorized distribution over
sequences, allowing to draw exact samples without replacement using a
Stochastic Beam Search. Even for exponentially large domains, the number of
model evaluations grows only linear in $k$ and the maximum sampled sequence
length. The algorithm creates a theoretical connection between sampling and
(deterministic) beam search and can be used as a principled intermediate
alternative. In a translation task, the proposed method compares favourably
against alternatives to obtain diverse yet good quality translations. We show
that sequences sampled without replacement can be used to construct
low-variance estimators for expected sentence-level BLEU score and model
entropy.},
