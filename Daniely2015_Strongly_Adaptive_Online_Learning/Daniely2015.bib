	abstract = {Strongly adaptive algorithms are algorithms whose performance on every time
interval is close to optimal. We present a reduction that can transform
standard low-regret algorithms to strongly adaptive. As a consequence, we
derive simple, yet efficient, strongly adaptive algorithms for a handful of
problems.},
