It is similar to max-entropy paper of Kakade&Hazan. Idea is taking random directions and learning policies which gives $\max_\pi V^\pi \delta^\intercal$ where  $\delta$ is a random direction.

Than it uses these maximal value functions to learn state representations

Its references are great which covers most representation learning for policy gradient methods.
