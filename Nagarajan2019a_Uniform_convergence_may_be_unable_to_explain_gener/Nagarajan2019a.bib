	abstract = {We cast doubt on the power of uniform convergence-based generalization bounds
to provide a complete picture of why overparameterized deep networks generalize
well. While it is well-known that many existing bounds are numerically large,
through a variety of experiments, we first bring to light another crucial and
more concerning aspect of these bounds: in practice, these bounds can {\em
increase} with the dataset size. Guided by our observations, we then present
examples of overparameterized linear classifiers and neural networks trained by
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) where uniform convergence provably cannot
`explain generalization,' even if we take into account implicit regularization
{\em to the fullest extent possible}. More precisely, even if we consider only
the set of classifiers output by SGD that have test errors less than some small
$\epsilon$, applying (two-sided) uniform convergence on this set of classifiers
yields a generalization guarantee that is larger than $1-\epsilon$ and is
therefore nearly vacuous.},
