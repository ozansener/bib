	abstract = {Importance sampling is one of the most widely used variance reduction
strategies in Monte Carlo rendering. In this paper, we propose a novel
importance sampling technique that uses a neural network to learn how to sample
from a desired density represented by a set of samples. Our approach considers
an existing Monte Carlo rendering algorithm as a black box. During a
scene-dependent training phase, we learn to generate samples with a desired
density in the primary sample space of the rendering algorithm using maximum
likelihood estimation. We leverage a recent neural network architecture that
was designed to represent real-valued non-volume preserving ('Real NVP')
transformations in high dimensional spaces. We use Real NVP to non-linearly
warp primary sample space and obtain desired densities. In addition, Real NVP
efficiently computes the determinant of the Jacobian of the warp, which is
required to implement the change of integration variables implied by the warp.
A main advantage of our approach is that it is agnostic of underlying light
transport effects, and can be combined with many existing rendering techniques
by treating them as a black box. We show that our approach leads to effective
variance reduction in several practical scenarios.},
