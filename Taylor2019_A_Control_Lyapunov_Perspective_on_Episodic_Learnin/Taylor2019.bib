	abstract = {The goal of this paper is to understand the impact of learning on control
synthesis from a Lyapunov function perspective. In particular, rather than
consider uncertainties in the full system dynamics, we employ Control Lyapunov
Functions (CLFs) as low-dimensional projections. To understand and characterize
the uncertainty that these projected dynamics introduce in the system, we
introduce a new notion: Projection to State Stability (PSS). PSS can be viewed
as a variant of Input to State Stability defined on projected dynamics, and
enables characterizing robustness of a CLF with respect to the data used to
learn system uncertainties. We use PSS to bound uncertainty in affine control,
and demonstrate that a practical episodic learning approach can use PSS to
characterize uncertainty in the CLF for robust control synthesis.},
