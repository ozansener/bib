	abstract = {Neural networks dominate the modern machine learning landscape, but their
training and success still suffer from sensitivity to empirical choices of
hyperparameters such as model architecture, loss function, and optimisation
algorithm. In this work we present \emph{Population Based Training (PBT)}, a
simple asynchronous optimisation algorithm which effectively utilises a fixed
computational budget to jointly optimise a population of models and their
hyperparameters to maximise performance. Importantly, PBT discovers a schedule
of hyperparameter settings rather than following the generally sub-optimal
strategy of trying to find a single fixed set to use for the whole course of
training. With just a small modification to a typical distributed
hyperparameter training framework, our method allows robust and reliable
training of models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PBT on deep
reinforcement learning problems, showing faster wall-clock convergence and
higher final performance of agents by optimising over a suite of
hyperparameters. In addition, we show the same method can be applied to
supervised learning for machine translation, where PBT is used to maximise the
BLEU score directly, and also to training of Generative Adversarial Networks to
maximise the Inception score of generated images. In all cases PBT results in
the automatic discovery of hyperparameter schedules and model selection which
results in stable training and better final performance.},
