	abstract = {Topology applied to real world data using persistent homology has started to
find applications within machine learning, including deep learning. We present
a differentiable topology layer that computes persistent homology based on
level set filtrations and distance-bases filtrations. We present three novel
applications: the topological layer can (i) serve as a regularizer directly on
data or the weights of machine learning models, (ii) construct a loss on the
output of a deep generative network to incorporate topological priors, and
(iii) perform topological adversarial attacks on deep networks trained with
persistence features. The code is publicly available and we hope its
availability will facilitate the use of persistent homology in deep learning
and other gradient based applications.},
