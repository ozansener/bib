	abstract = {Batch Normalization (BN) is a milestone technique in the development of deep
learning, enabling various networks to train. However, normalizing along the
batch dimension introduces problems --- BN's error increases rapidly when the
batch size becomes smaller, caused by inaccurate batch statistics estimation.
This limits BN's usage for training larger models and transferring features to
computer vision tasks including detection, segmentation, and video, which
require small batches constrained by memory consumption. In this paper, we
present Group Normalization (GN) as a simple alternative to BN. GN divides the
channels into groups and computes within each group the mean and variance for
normalization. GN's computation is independent of batch sizes, and its accuracy
is stable in a wide range of batch sizes. On ResNet-50 trained in ImageNet, GN
has 10.6% lower error than its BN counterpart when using a batch size of 2;
when using typical batch sizes, GN is comparably good with BN and outperforms
other normalization variants. Moreover, GN can be naturally transferred from
pre-training to fine-tuning. GN can outperform its BN-based counterparts for
object detection and segmentation in COCO, and for video classification in
Kinetics, showing that GN can effectively replace the powerful BN in a variety
of tasks. GN can be easily implemented by a few lines of code in modern
libraries.},
