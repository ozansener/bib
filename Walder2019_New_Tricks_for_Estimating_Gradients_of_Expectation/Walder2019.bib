	abstract = {We derive a family of Monte Carlo estimators for gradients of expectations of
univariate distributions, which is related to the log-derivative trick, but
involves pairwise interactions between samples. The first of these comes from
either a) introducing and approximating an integral representation based on the
fundamental theorem of calculus, or b) applying the reparameterisation trick to
an implicit parameterisation under infinitesimal perturbation of the
parameters. From the former perspective we generalise to a reproducing kernel
Hilbert space representation, giving rise to locality parameter in the pairwise
interactions mentioned above. The resulting estimators are unbiased and shown
to offer an independent component of useful information in comparison with the
log-derivative estimator. Promising analytical and numerical examples confirm
the intuitions behind the new estimators.},
