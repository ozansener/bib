	abstract = {In many machine learning applications, one needs to interactively select a
sequence of items (e.g., recommending movies based on a user's feedback) or
make sequential decisions in certain orders (e.g., guiding an agent through a
series of states). Not only do sequences already pose a dauntingly large search
space, but we must take into account past observations, as well as the
uncertainty of future outcomes. Without further structure, finding an optimal
sequence is notoriously challenging, if not completely intractable.
  In this paper, we introduce adaptive sequence submodularity, a rich framework
that generalizes the notion of submodularity to adaptive policies that
explicitly consider sequential dependencies between items. We show that once
such dependencies are encoded by a directed graph, an adaptive greedy policy is
guaranteed to achieve a constant factor approximation guarantee, where the
constant naturally depends on the structural properties of the underlying
graph. Additionally, to demonstrate the practical utility of our results, we
run experiments on Amazon product recommendation and Wikipedia link prediction
tasks.},
