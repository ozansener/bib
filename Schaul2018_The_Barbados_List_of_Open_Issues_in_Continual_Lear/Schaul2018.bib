	abstract = {We want to make progress toward artificial general intelligence, namely
general-purpose agents that autonomously learn how to competently act in
complex environments. The purpose of this report is to sketch a research
outline, share some of the most important open issues we are facing, and
stimulate further discussion in the community. The content is based on some of
our discussions during a week-long workshop held in Barbados in February 2018.},
