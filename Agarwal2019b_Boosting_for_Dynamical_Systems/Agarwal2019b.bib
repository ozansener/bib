	abstract = {We propose a framework of boosting for learning and control in environments
that maintain a state. Leveraging methods for online learning with memory and
for online boosting, we design an efficient online algorithm that can provably
improve the accuracy of weak-learners in stateful environments. As a
consequence, we give efficient boosting algorithms for both prediction and the
control of dynamical systems. Empirical evaluation on simulated and real data
for both control and prediction supports our theoretical findings.},
