	abstract = {We propose to use deep neural networks for generating samples in Monte Carlo
integration. Our work is based on non-linear independent component analysis,
which we extend in numerous ways to improve performance and enable its
application to integration problems. First, we introduce piecewise-polynomial
coupling transforms that greatly increase the modeling power of individual
coupling layers. Second, we propose to preprocess the inputs of neural networks
using one-blob encoding, which stimulates localization of computation and
improves inference. Third, we derive a gradient-descent-based optimization for
the KL and the $\chi^2$ divergence for the specific application of Monte Carlo
integration with stochastic estimates of the target distribution. Our approach
enables fast and accurate inference and efficient sample generation independent
of the dimensionality of the integration domain. We demonstrate the benefits of
our approach for generating natural images and in two applications to
light-transport simulation. First, we show how to learn joint path-sampling
densities in primary sample space and how to importance sample
multi-dimensional path prefixes thereof. Second, we use our technique to
extract conditional directional densities driven by the triple product of the
rendering equation, and leverage them for path guiding. In all applications,
our approach yields on-par or higher performance at equal sample count than
competing techniques.},
