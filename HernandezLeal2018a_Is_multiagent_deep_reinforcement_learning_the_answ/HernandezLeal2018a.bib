	abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved outstanding results in recent
years. This has led to a dramatic increase in the number of applications and
methods. Recent works have explored learning beyond single-agent scenarios and
have considered multiagent scenarios. Initial results report successes in
complex multiagent domains, although there are several challenges to be
addressed. In this context, first, this article provides a clear overview of
current multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MDRL) literature. Second, it
provides guidelines to complement this emerging area by (i) showcasing examples
on how methods and algorithms from DRL and multiagent learning (MAL) have
helped solve problems in MDRL and (ii) providing general lessons learned from
these works. We expect this article will help unify and motivate future
research to take advantage of the abundant literature that exists in both areas
(DRL and MAL) in a joint effort to promote fruitful research in the multiagent
community.},
