	abstract = {In an online optimization problem we are required to choose a sequence of
points from a fixed feasible subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$. After each point is
chosen, a function over the set is revealed and we accumulate payoff equal to
the function value at the point. We consider the class of piecewise Lipschitz
functions, which is the most general setting considered in the literature for
the problem, and arises naturally in various combinatorial algorithm selection
problems where utility functions can have sharp discontinuities. The usual
performance metric of `static' regret minimizes the gap between the payoff
accumulated and that of the best fixed point for the entire duration, and thus
fails to capture changing environments. Shifting regret is a useful
alternative, which allows for up to $s$ environment shifts. In this work we
provide an $O(\sqrt{sdT\log T}+sT^{1-\beta})$ regret bound for
$\beta$-dispersed functions, where $\beta$ roughly quantifies the rate at which
discontinuities appear in the utility functions in expectation (typically
$\beta\ge1/2$ in problems of practical interest). We show this bound is optimal
up to sub-logarithmic factors. We further show how to improve the bounds when
selecting from a small pool of experts. We empirically demonstrate a key
application of our algorithms to online clustering problems, with 15-40%
relative gain over static regret based algorithms on popular benchmarks.},
