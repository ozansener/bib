	abstract = {We provide a brief tutorial on the use of concentration inequalities as they
apply to system identification of state-space parameters of linear time
invariant systems, with a focus on the fully observed setting. We draw upon
tools from the theories of large-deviations and self-normalized martingales,
and provide both data-dependent and independent bounds on the learning rate.},
