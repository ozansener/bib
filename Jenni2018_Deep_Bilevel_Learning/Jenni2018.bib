	abstract = {We present a novel regularization approach to train neural networks that
enjoys better generalization and test error than standard stochastic gradient
descent. Our approach is based on the principles of cross-validation, where a
validation set is used to limit the model overfitting. We formulate such
principles as a bilevel optimization problem. This formulation allows us to
define the optimization of a cost on the validation set subject to another
optimization on the training set. The overfitting is controlled by introducing
weights on each mini-batch in the training set and by choosing their values so
that they minimize the error on the validation set. In practice, these weights
define mini-batch learning rates in a gradient descent update equation that
favor gradients with better generalization capabilities. Because of its
simplicity, this approach can be integrated with other regularization methods
and training schemes. We evaluate extensively our proposed algorithm on several
neural network architectures and datasets, and find that it consistently
improves the generalization of the model, especially when labels are noisy.},
