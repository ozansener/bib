	abstract = {Deep learning models are considered to be state-of-the-art in many offline
machine learning tasks. However, many of the techniques developed are not
suitable for online learning tasks. The problem of using deep learning models
with sequential data becomes even harder when several loss functions need to be
considered simultaneously, as in many real-world applications. In this paper,
we, therefore, propose a novel online deep learning training procedure which
can be used regardless of the neural network's architecture, aiming to deal
with the multiple objectives case. We demonstrate and show the effectiveness of
our algorithm on the Neyman-Pearson classification problem on several benchmark
datasets.},
