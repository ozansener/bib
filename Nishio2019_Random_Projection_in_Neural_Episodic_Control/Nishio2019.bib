	abstract = {End-to-end deep reinforcement learning has enabled agents to learn with
little preprocessing by humans. However, it is still difficult to learn stably
and efficiently because the learning method usually uses a nonlinear function
approximation. Neural Episodic Control (NEC), which has been proposed in order
to improve sample efficiency, is able to learn stably by estimating action
values using a non-parametric method. In this paper, we propose an architecture
that incorporates random projection into NEC to train with more stability. In
addition, we verify the effectiveness of our architecture by Atari's five
games. The main idea is to reduce the number of parameters that have to learn
by replacing neural networks with random projection in order to reduce
dimensions while keeping the learning end-to-end.},
