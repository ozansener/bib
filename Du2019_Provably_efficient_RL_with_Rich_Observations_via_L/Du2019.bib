	abstract = {We study the exploration problem in episodic MDPs with rich observations
generated from a small number of latent states. Under certain identifiability
assumptions, we demonstrate how to estimate a mapping from the observations to
latent states inductively through a sequence of regression and clustering
steps---where previously decoded latent states provide labels for later
regression problems---and use it to construct good exploration policies. We
provide finite-sample guarantees on the quality of the learned state decoding
function and exploration policies, and complement our theory with an empirical
evaluation on a class of hard exploration problems. Our method exponentially
improves over $Q$-learning with na\"ive exploration, even when $Q$-learning has
cheating access to latent states.},
