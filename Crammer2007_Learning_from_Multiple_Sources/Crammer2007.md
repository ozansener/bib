Main idea is you are giving bunch of domains with bunch of data points. And, they bound the expected error in terms of distance between domains (expected loss of data generating function of one of them, in another). Main tradeoff is with more data your expected error increases, but uniform convergence gets better. In covariate shift setting, this is interesting since ideally it should always help but it does not if p(x) is different.
