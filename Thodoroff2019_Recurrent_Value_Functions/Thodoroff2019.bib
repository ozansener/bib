	abstract = {Despite recent successes in Reinforcement Learning, value-based methods often
suffer from high variance hindering performance. In this paper, we illustrate
this in a continuous control setting where state of the art methods perform
poorly whenever sensor noise is introduced. To overcome this issue, we
introduce Recurrent Value Functions (RVFs) as an alternative to estimate the
value function of a state. We propose to estimate the value function of the
current state using the value function of past states visited along the
trajectory. Due to the nature of their formulation, RVFs have a natural way of
learning an emphasis function that selectively emphasizes important states.
First, we establish RVF's asymptotic convergence properties in tabular
settings. We then demonstrate their robustness on a partially observable domain
and continuous control tasks. Finally, we provide a qualitative interpretation
of the learned emphasis function.},
