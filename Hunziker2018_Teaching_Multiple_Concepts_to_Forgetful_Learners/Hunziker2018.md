Basic idea is trying to find a schedule so you do not forget things. Main model is exponential forgetting as probability of remembering decreases with time. They optimize for quickest learning as in area under the curve (accumulative probability of recal). Algorithm is choosing the one with largest marginal gain. Since remembering is in general submodular this greedy algorithm makes sense.
