	abstract = {How can we help a forgetful learner learn multiple concepts within a limited
time frame? For long-term learning, it is crucial to devise teaching strategies
that leverage the underlying forgetting mechanisms of the learners. In this
paper, we cast the problem of adaptively teaching a forgetful learner as a
novel discrete optimization problem, where we seek to optimize a natural
objective function that characterizes the learner's expected performance
throughout the teaching session. We then propose a simple greedy teaching
strategy and derive strong performance guarantees based on two intuitive
data-dependent parameters, which characterize the degree of diminishing returns
of teaching each concept. We show that, given some assumptions of the learner's
memory model, one can efficiently compute the performance bounds. Furthermore,
we identify parameter settings of our memory models where greedy is guaranteed
to achieve high performance. We have deployed our approach in two concrete
applications, namely (1) an educational app for online vocabulary teaching and
(2) an app for teaching novices how to recognize bird species. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our algorithm using simulations along with user studies.},
